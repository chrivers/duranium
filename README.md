# Duranium [templates] #

Duranium [transwarp](https://github.com/chrivers/transwarp)
templates. Duranium is a memory safe, high-performance,
high-correctness implementation of the
[Artemis](http://artemis.eochu.com/) network protocol, implemented in
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

It is based on the [Isolinear
Chips](https://github.com/chrivers/isolinear-chips) project, which
contains the most detailed and up-to-date protocol specification.

The protocol specification is parsed by the
[transwarp](https://github.com/chrivers/transwarp) compiler, and made
available to the templates, which are then compiled into the output
files.

This project contains the template files. In all likelyhood, they will
be merged into the main duranium repository at some point in the
future.
